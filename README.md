# BetterTimetable

The BetterTimetable project, developed for Code Network using **NextJS (TypsScript)**, enhances students' experience by creating a user-friendly timetable. It integrates React elements for effective data display and uses server components to process QUT course data into an organized API, which populates timetables based on student preferences.

Part 1 ‚Äì Create the Database Schema
1. Open MySQL Command Line client by typing in ‚ÄòMySQL 8.0 Command Line Client‚Äô to
Windows Searchbar
2. If you click to open the Command Line client, then you will need to insert the password
you created earlier when setting up MySQL Workbench
3. Type the following commands and press enter
```bash
CREATE USER 'BetterTimetable'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY
'BetterTimetable1';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'BetterTimetable'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
CREATE DATABASE betterTimetable;
```

<br>

Part 2 ‚Äì Populate the Database Schema
1. Open the front-end repository with Visual Studio Code
2. Run command ‚Äúnpm install‚Äù in the terminal

<br><br>

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Running BetterTimetable
1. Run the development server through VS Code Command Line Interface
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your local server via your web browser to see the result
```bash
 http://localhost:3000
```

<br><br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: for type-safe JavaScript development.
- **HTML**: for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: for global styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: for utility-first CSS framework.
- **React**: as the library for building user interfaces.
- **Drizzle ORM**: for object-relational mapping.
- **SQL**: for database management.

<br><br>

## üß™ Methodology
API Data Pipeline
- **Get Course Data**: Fetch QUT Course Data to identify activities for each unit and their timeslots
- **Get Teaching Periods**: Fetch QUT Teaching Periods to identify when courses are offered

<br>

Manage Data and Show Timetable
- **Allocate Timeslots**: Extract one timeslot from each given activity that does not clash. Consider student needs when selecting timeslots
- **Output Timetable**: Show a grid output of the given timeslots for the selected units

<br><br>
