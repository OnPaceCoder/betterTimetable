# BetterTimetable

The BetterTimetable project, developed for Code Network using **NextJS (TypsScript)**, enhances students' experience by creating a user-friendly timetable. It integrates React elements for effective data display and uses server components to process QUT course data into an organized API, which populates timetables based on student preferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: for type-safe JavaScript development.
- **HTML**: for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: for global styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: for utility-first CSS framework.
- **React**: as the library for building user interfaces.
- **Drizzle ORM**: for object-relational mapping.
- **SQL**: for database management.


## üß™ Methodology
API Data Pipeline
- **Get Course Data**: Fetch QUT Course Data to identify activities for each unit and their timeslots
- **Get Teaching Periods**: Fetch QUT Teaching Periods to identify when courses are offered

Manage Data and Show Timetable
- **Allocate Timeslots**: Extract one timeslot from each given activity that does not clash. Consider student needs when selecting timeslots
- **Output Timetable**: Show a grid output of the given timeslots for the selected units
